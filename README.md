# NLP Applications: Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews

## Description

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews. The goal is to automatically classify the sentiment of user-submitted product reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. This analysis provides valuable insights into customer satisfaction and can help businesses improve their products and services. Utilizing the spaCy library and SpacyTextBlob, the project processes large volumes of text data, cleans it, and applies sentiment analysis to determine the underlying sentiment in each review.
